# Deep-research prompt — OpenAPI typed client generation (R84, crate)

## Objective
Consumer: the implementation plan for `rs-launch-blueprint`, a Rust template shaped as CLI + library + web service. Deliver a named crate with a version range for: whether a Rust-ecosystem equivalent of `openapi-python-client` exists for generating a typed HTTP client from the committed OpenAPI snapshot, never hand-written. Item kind: `crate`. Value test: if this answer is wrong, the generated-client crate/module, the codegen recipe invoking it, and any consumer code depending on its generated types all get rewritten.

## Context
- Research mandate (owner clarification 2026-09-04, spec §2/A5): identify the shared engineering principle, the level at which agreement is required (capability, standard, architectural pattern or policy), and observable acceptance criteria; then research the architectures and libraries that best realize them in this ecosystem. Source implementations and ledger classifications are evidence, not predetermined winners. Agreement, familiarity, or maximum benchmark throughput alone cannot select a design. This mandate supersedes inherited-mechanism wording below; explicit owner requirements, fixed parameters, and dependency ownership remain binding. Report a challenged baseline as `BASELINE-REVIEW: F### — principle — proposed change — evidence` in the answer; do not silently change another item or the ledger.
- Source precedent (spec §2): py generates its typed API client from the committed OpenAPI snapshot via a `Justfile` recipe, never by hand; ts has no web service or OpenAPI schema to generate a client from. Evidence: py `Justfile:312` — `uvx openapi-python-client generate --path docs/api/openapi.json --output-path {{out}} --overwrite`; ts: none (no web service exists in ts; F303). Ledger rows: F335 (`docs/port/COMMONALITY.md`), verdict `DIVERGENT`. Note: F335 was split out of R71 (`openapi-generation-pipeline`) at the Task 10 reconciliation because typed client generation is its own tool-ecosystem survey, independent of the schema-generation, snapshot-diff, and fuzzing picks.
- Recorded baseline and owner-fixed parameters (apply the research mandate above): target shape is CLI + library + web service (spec §4 D7); `rust-edition` = `2024`, `msrv-policy` = "stable minus 2 minor versions, raised only in a minor release, declared as rust-version in Cargo.toml and tested in CI", `license` = `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, `target-os-matrix` = `ubuntu-latest, macos-latest` (`docs/port/PARAMETERS.md`, fixed, owner-decided 2026-09-02). The OpenAPI schema/snapshot this item's client is generated from is decided by R71 (`openapi-generation-pipeline`), still open — assume some committed OpenAPI document with curated, stable operation ids exists (F312, F332) without picking its generator.
- Prior decisions of the TypeScript port that explain the current shape: none — ts never built a web service, so `TS_PORT_DECISIONS.md` has no entry addressing typed client generation.
- Owner direction (2026-09-04, recorded in `docs/port/OWNER-REVIEW.md`): Again, because this is a superior and more mature pattern for Python, we should take the principles and apply the same research and the same solution set for TypeScript and Rust.

## Out of scope
- Which crate/pattern generates the OpenAPI schema itself, its operation-id curation, and its snapshot-diff/breaking-change detection; R71 (`openapi-generation-pipeline`) owns F307/F312/F332/F333 — this item only generates a client from an already-produced schema, it does not generate the schema.
- OpenAPI-schema-driven contract fuzzing against the same schema; R83 (`openapi-contract-fuzzing`) owns F334 — a sibling item split from the same R71 reconciliation, do not conflate fuzzing with client generation.
- Whether the template adopts a web framework at all, and which one; R69 (`web-framework-stack`) owns `web-extra-surface` — this item does not pick a framework, it decides the client-generation tool and describes how it consumes any candidate framework's served schema.
- Prior art in the owner's other Rust repositories — do not look for or cite it.

## Couplings
- id: R84
- owns:
- consumes: R69: web-extra-surface
- related (not a registry dependency): R71 (`openapi-generation-pipeline`) decides the OpenAPI schema/snapshot generator this item's client is generated from (F312, F332); assume R71 resolves to *some* committed schema with stable operation ids and design the codegen recipe to consume it generically, without picking the generator.
- related (not a registry dependency): R83 (`openapi-contract-fuzzing`) is the sibling item split from R71 at the same Task 10 reconciliation; it decides fuzzing against the same schema, a separate concern from client generation.
If your recommendation needs a consumed parameter to change, do not change it: write `CONFLICT: R## <param> — <needed value> — <reason>` in the `Parameters` field of your answer.

## Questions
Decision: does a Rust-ecosystem equivalent of `openapi-python-client` exist for generating a typed HTTP client from the committed OpenAPI snapshot, never hand-written, and if so what crate/tool/recipe implements it.
- HIGH: What Rust codegen tools/crates generate a typed client crate/module from an OpenAPI 3.x document (candidates to investigate: `openapi-generator`'s Rust generators (reqwest-based), `progenitor`, hand-rolled codegen driven by `openapiv3`, or a `utoipa`-adjacent client-generation story if one exists)?
- HIGH: Does the leading candidate integrate as a standalone recipe (a `just`/`cargo xtask` step invoked against the committed snapshot file, matching py's `openapi-python-client generate` recipe), or does it require a `build.rs`/proc-macro approach compiled directly into a consuming crate — and which fits a CLI + library + web template's workspace layout better?
- HIGH (owner clarification 2026-09-04): Which engineering principles and agreement levels must this item preserve across py-launch-blueprint, ts-launch-blueprint and rs-launch-blueprint, and which architectures, libraries or conventions best realize them in each ecosystem? Use the existing implementations and their research as evidence, without assuming any repo is the winner. Distinguish missing capability or accidental drift from justified ecosystem differences. Preserve agreement at the declared level. Recommend a shared low-level value only when it is an explicit owner requirement or evidence supports the same tradeoff in all affected ecosystems; otherwise explain each justified difference and how it preserves the principle. Changes to py and ts remain a follow-on project; this answer supplies their rationale. The owner requested this cross-repo comparison even though the earlier divergence analysis marked it `harmonize: no`; that label does not predetermine the answer.
- MEDIUM: Is the generated client idiomatic enough for direct use in the workspace (async, `reqwest`-based or similar, typed request/response structs matching the schema) to be a fair drop-in, or does it produce boilerplate requiring a hand-written wrapper layer before other crates in the workspace can consume it?
- MEDIUM: Does the candidate depend on the schema's operation-id curation (F312, owned by R71) to produce stable, human-readable generated method names across regenerations, the same dependency py's `openapi-python-client` has on FastAPI's curated `operation_id`s — and what happens to generated names if that curation is absent?
- LOW: What is the maturity/adoption level of the leading candidate(s), given typed OpenAPI-to-Rust client generation is a narrower tool-ecosystem niche than general OpenAPI schema generation?

## Required evidence
Survey method (owner direction, 2026-09-04) — forest before trees. Do these four steps before evaluating any candidate, and report them under `### Landscape`:
1. Landscape first: name the category this item decides and map the Rust field in three bins — built-in or first-party toolchain · established industry standard · up-and-comer. Every shortlisted candidate comes from that map, never from prior familiarity alone.
2. Authority is established, not assumed: draw on a diverse set of authoritative sources and state why each is authoritative (Rust project and team publications, RFCs and working-group output, the annual Rust survey, maintainers' own documentation, widely cited independent write-ups). A single blog post is a lead, not an authority.
3. Practice evidence: survey what mainstream, well-regarded Rust projects use, weighting newer popular ones, and cite the evidence that they are well regarded (adoption, maintainer standing, community references) rather than asserting it.
4. Fit over abstract best: judge every candidate against the use case this template presents (CLI · library · web service) and the py and ts precedent in `## Context`, not against "best in general".

Architecture and example evidence (owner clarification A5): extract the principle behind each source choice and evaluate it against current authoritative guidance and production practice. Compare significant architectural alternatives, not only replacement libraries. A library already named in this prompt is a research lead, not a closed shortlist. For every recommendation cite a maintained reference implementation, or state the evidence gap; explain how the full example composes and how its behavior will be verified. Evaluate performance with workload, configuration, instrumentation, latency, throughput and resource cost stated; do not infer an absolute fastest option from unlike benchmarks.

Collect every figure exactly this way and cite endpoint + retrieval date (spec §7.6):
| Figure | Source | Field / rule |
|---|---|---|
| 90-day downloads | `GET https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>` | `crate.recent_downloads` |
| All-time downloads | same | `crate.downloads` |
| Last release | `GET https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>/versions` | newest with `yanked: false`: `num`, `created_at` |
| Stars, archived | `GET https://api.github.com/repos/<o>/<r>` | `stargazers_count`, `archived`, `pushed_at` |
| Open issues | `GET https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:<o>/<r>+is:issue+is:open` | `total_count` (never `open_issues_count`) |
| Issue responsiveness | 10 most recently opened issues | median days to first maintainer response; unanswered count |
| Advisories | `https://rustsec.org/packages/<name>.html` | open advisories |
| Adopters | reverse-dependencies page + the projects' `Cargo.toml` | name + source link demonstrating adoption and why the project is a relevant, well-regarded reference |

Maintenance state by rubric, one of `active | stable-quiet | at-risk | dormant | archived`: no release in 6 months is a trigger to investigate, never the verdict; `at-risk` needs a concrete signal; `dormant` needs an unpatched advisory, a broken build on current stable, or a maintainer's own notice.

Fitness gates, answered per candidate **before** popularity is weighed; a failed gate lists the candidate under *Excluded by gate*:
1. license compatible with `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
2. crate and dependency-tree MSRV within `stable minus 2 minor versions, raised only in a minor release, declared as rust-version in Cargo.toml and tested in CI`;
3. no open RustSec advisory; `unsafe` posture stated;
4. builds and is tested on every OS in `ubuntu-latest, macos-latest` (CI badge or a stated platform list); Windows support noted, not required;
5. default features and any async-runtime coupling stated;
6. binary-size and compile-time cost stated qualitatively.

## Answer template
Use exactly these field names as H3 headings, in this order.

### Landscape
The survey-method output (`## Required evidence`): the three-bin map with the candidates found in each, the authoritative sources used and why each counts, and the well-regarded projects surveyed with the evidence that they are well regarded.
### Principles and implementation
State the shared requirement, its source and agreement level, the essential behaviors, and observable acceptance criteria. Distinguish what must agree from what may vary. If an architectural pattern is shared, verify that it remains appropriate in the target ecosystem. Compare architectural alternatives before choosing libraries; explain how the recommended design preserves each principle and where a different ecosystem needs a different design. Cite production usage and maintained reference examples, compare maturity, dependability, representative performance and integration cost, and explain the tradeoffs. Specify a minimal realistic example and an executable acceptance check; distinguish proposed checks from checks actually run. Include any `BASELINE-REVIEW:` finding with its feature ID, affected items and evidence.

Up to five that passed every gate (fewer is a finding): name · role · 90-day downloads · all-time downloads · stars · last release · maintenance state · notable adopters · one-line trade-off.
### Excluded by gate
### Up-and-comers
### Fit for this template
CLI · library · web, separately.
### Recommendation
### Ranked runner-up
And the condition under which it wins.
### Tradeoffs
